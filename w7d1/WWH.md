# React!

React is a _library_ (framebrary)

## React !== JSX

JSX =>Â JavaScript and XML

- Smells like HTML
- Looks like HTML
- Tastes like HTML
- BUT IT'S NOT HTML


JSX and HTML share 99% of HTML's behavior

```jsx
  <p className="" style={{marginTop:"1em"}}>Hello!</p>
```

## React Rendering Process

## React is Component based

## React props!
