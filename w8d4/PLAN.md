# Weather App

# Project Description

Fetches the weather based on a city, creates a button for new cities, fetches user position on first load

# User Stories

Features of the app, from the perspective of a user (How a user would use our app)

- A user should be able to go to our website, type in a city, and retrieve the weather for it
- A user should be able to quickly see the weather from previously searched cities, and see the weather for them
- A user should be able to search for the same city multiple times, without creating additional entries in the history

# Testing

End-to-End testing => From a user's perspective (User flow / feature-ish)

Integration testing => Function that converts the API call to something usable for our components,

Unit testing => K to Celsius conversion
